# DEI-Filler
This is a script which generates a PDF and an associated complaint about gender and diversity, to help with filling such forms in. It was entirely AI generated as a learning project.

When one encounters such helpful forms as https://enddei.ed.gov/ one really feels the need to make sure they get as much information as possible. This script generates that content. It could do with a tweak to pull real school data - since the list is currently fictional. Also the size estimation is poor - it's targeting 9 mb but sometimes produces way less.
